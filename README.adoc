GitOps. 

toc::[]

== Overview

This projects represents the main IT architecture/governance configuration for managing a cluster for various teams with different Kubernetes/OpenShift capabilities. Using the GitOps approach.

It uses primarily link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/cicd/gitops/understanding-openshift-gitops.html[OpenShift GitOps] which includes link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[ArgoCD].

The main objective is, to have one place for managing the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster the GitOps way. This includes the following use cases

* *bootstrap* the existing cluster with main/base *capabilities* like Pipeline support, Secrets Management or similar
* *manage* the teams and apps which includes the namespaces and corresponding pipeline configurations
* *governance* all other IT architecture and governance related policies

All use cases (features/capabilities) will be handled with OpenShift GitOps/ArgoCD. This allows flexible modification and expansion of the capabilities.

This solution contains the following components

* link:gitops-bootstrap[]: the bootstrap definition to install ArgoCD and configure the foundation 
* link:governance/cluster-configs.json[]: the cluster configuration 
* link:argocd-project-template[]: the standardized project template as ArgoCD configuration which will be applied for the teams/apps
* link:tekton[]: Base Tekton task and pipeline definitions

The initial bootstrap will be started with applying the Kubernetes manifest files from link:gitops-bootstrap[]. This installs the OpenShift GitOps operator if necessary and register a new ArgoCD `ApplicationSet` listening on the link:governance/cluster-configs.json[], which contains the configuration for all the cluster capabilities (like Operators, SonarQube or similar) and to maintained applications.

This approach allows a very simple extension of the capabilities (aka ArgoCD applications).

In <<Img1>> we see the relationship of the main components (ArgoCD and Kubernetes resources) for one team/project.

The `governance` `ApplicationSet` holds all common applications, including the `gov-teams` which represents the configuration for all teams/projects.
Every team receives 

* a `cicd` namespace holding the Tekton resources,
* the environment related namespaces (e.g. for test, int, prod)
* and ArgoCD `Applications` managing the resources in the dedicated namespaces

The configuration for a team/project is defined in link:argocd-project-template/values.yaml[]. Relevant are the main attributes for

* Git configuration (repo, revision)
* name of the `config.json` 
* the individual namespaces

Any team has the same structure, see <<Img2>>.

And <<Img3>> give an impression about the relationship to the git repositories.

== GitOps Features

This chapters list all the available features in this setup

* uses ArgoCD for the cluster configuration reconciliation 
* manages all cluster capabilities in a JSON file which is the base for `ApplicationSet`
* creates for any team/project an own `ArgoCD` and `Project` instance
* bound git repo of the team to the ArgoCD Project instance for more/better multi-tenant restriction
* define policies which limit the access to the ArgoCD resources
* define OpenShift Groups which can be used to link users to ArgoCD policy groups
* creates a project structure in OpenShift with predefined namespaces + an additional namespace for all the pipeline resources
* configures ArgoCD to exclude `PipelineRun` and `TaskRun`, this allows to manually execute/run such runs (for testing)
* Optimize ArgoCD and enable only selective synchronization (out-of-sync) instead always all resources
* enable Prometheus monitoring for the ArgoCD resources


== Usage

.Initialize
----
$ helm template gov gitops-bootstrap --output-dir=work/gov -f gitops-bootstrap/values.<...>.yaml

$ oc apply -f work/gov/argocd/templates
----

Rest only via modification of the manifest files in the directory. E.g.

* adding new teams/project => link:argocd-project-template/values.yaml[]
* add a new capability to the cluster (e.g. HashiCorp Vault instance) => link:governance/cluster-configs.json[]
* Enhance/Fix Tekton pipeline definitions => link:tekton[]
* Set NetworkPolicies for all projects, but transparent from the dev teams => link:argocd-project-template[]


== Summary

GitOps and IT-Governance to manage a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster for various teams and capabilities.
